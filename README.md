# GRAL Validation Data Sets<br>
Here we provide some validation projects waiting to be downloaded.<br>
You can use the validation data sets to learn how to use the model or to check modifications of individual parameters and settings, such as the surface roughness lenght. For these data sets, spreadsheets with reference values of the experiments are available to easily assess the effects and sensitivity of the changes.<br><br>
**The data sets originate from the AERMOD homepage:**<br>

<br>
The GRAL projects are configured in the same way as for the calculation of the validation documented in the GRAL manual.
<br>
The following data sets are currently available: <br>

One stack source and one building [AGA Texas](/AGA_Texas/README.md)<br>
One stack source and complex terrain [West Vaco](/WestVaco/README.md)<br>
Dry deposition mass conservation [Mass Conservation](/DepositionMassConservation/README.md)
