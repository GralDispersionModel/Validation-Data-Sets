# GRAL Validation Test Cases<br>
Here we provide some validation projects waiting to be downloaded.<br>
You can use the validation test cases to learn how to use the model or to check modifications of individual parameters and settings, such as the surface roughness lenght, the concentration grid size or the size of the flow field mesh. These data sets include spreadsheets with reference values for an easy assessment of the effects and sensitivity of project modifications.<br><br>
The GRAL projects are configured in almost the same way as for the calculation of the validation documented in the GRAL manual.
<br>
The following test cases are currently available: <br>

One stack source and one building [AGA Texas](/AGA_Texas/README.md)<br>
One stack source and complex terrain [West Vaco](/WestVaco/README.md)<br>
Dry deposition mass conservation [Mass Conservation](/DepositionMassConservation/README.md)
