# GRAL Validation Test Case Texas<br>
This is a basic test case with a stack source having 2 release heights and one building:  Flat terrain, rural, downwash.<br>

The GRAL test case was developed based on an AERMOD evaluation test case (EPA-454/R-03-003):

One should consider that observed and predicted hourly concentration values are highly chaotic and Arc-Max values are used to assess the model performance in this test case. Therefore, we use the average of the Arc-Max values of all experiments and arcs to assess the model quality.<br><br>
